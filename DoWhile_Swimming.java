/*
Q1. Gallant and Goofus both swim for 4 minutes.

Q2. Gallant swims for 0 minutes and Goofus swims for 1 minute.

Q3. Gallant checks for the water temperature.

Q4. Goofus does not check for the water temperature.

Q5. A do while loop executes a block of statement(s) before a condition is tested 
whilst a while loop tests for a condition before execution.

Q6. The while loop is the pre-test loop whilst the do while loop is the post-test loop.
